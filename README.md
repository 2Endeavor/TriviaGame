Trivia game.
This trivia game currently works!

The timer allows the person 30 seconds to take the quiz. At the end of 30 seconds, the program automatically goes to a screen that shows the results of the exam.

If the person finishes before 30 seconds has expired, there is a stop button that allows the test taker to stop the countdown and go immediately to the results page.

The program reports out on the following:

•	Number of correct answers

•	Number of incorrect answers

•	Number of unanswered or skipped questions.


This was a very difficult assignment for me. I struggled with getting the timer to work and with identifying the selections made by the user. In working on this project, I found myself buried in the weeds and ended up copying my js code into another file and starting over to gain some clarity. 

I really wanted to do a good job on this project. I had hoped to have time to make an attractive UI  and provide more information for the user-Specifically, I wanted to provide the correct answers for the questions missed.

I hope, as with many of my other projects, to come back to this code in the near future and clean it up!

Thank you for taking the time to review and evaluate my work.
